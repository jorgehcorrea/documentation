Sistema de Monitoreo Inalambrico

## Overview

This section will record the development in using the nRF24L01 system. Wi-Fi System. 

---

##  The Concept

The final concept through this system is to connect the nRF24 module to the internet, and alert potential risk factors that can harm the development of the pilones. 

* The tweet platform [arduino-tweet]  
* The connection between nRF24 to Wi-Fi, links [1],[2] & [3]  
	* Apparently it is not possible to connect the nRF24l01 to a normal Wi-Fi Network. 
* The connection between nRF24 and Arduino Uno [nrf24l01-arduino] & [SPI]

Different to the 433mhz RF, the Wi-fi modules is able to send and verify that the data package has been received, making the communication much more reliable.

## Details: nRF24l01  

The nrf24l01, as far as I can tell cannot be connected to the Wi-Fi network easily. Yet there is a large amount of information that can be saved for further reference.   
The interesting part of the nrf24l01, a deviation module: nRF24L01 - PA LNA with External Antenna can get distances of 1000m (without obstructions) with the added advantage that the system will ratify the delivered data package.

###Final thoughts

After the investigation, will move on to use the ESP8266 Module as it shows to be relevant in this project. I have left a bunch of documentation regarding the works of the Nrf24L01, as it could be a possible replacement for the 433, in the case that the multi-user with it goes south. The transition system offered by 2.4ghz, and the fact that it is secure. It also has to be mentioned that the arduino uno can only handle 2 nRF24 slaves.
